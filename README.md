# 🧮 Simple Calculator
 A simple GUI calculator made using `Python`
 
 ## 📘Libraries/Modules
  - `tkinter`

## 📃Features
  - Simple math functions: *addition*, *subtraction*, *multiplication*, *division*

## 🎯This project taught me:
 - Introduction to `tkinter`
     - Grid Layout
     - Labels
     - Input box
     - Buttons

## To make this project better, the next update (if it has one) will:
  - Allow the user to use their keyboard to run the math functions
  - Become a standalone app

## ⬇️ Updates:
 - **version 1.0** - *completed* `Jul 14 2022`  *uploaded* `20 Feb 2024`

## ▶️ Running it locally:
- Ensure Python is installed locally, and that the `tkinter` library is also installed.
- Download the Python file, open it either with Python IDLE or any other Python interpreter, then run it
- Use the on-screen built-in buttons for simple calculations (*as of version 1.0*)
